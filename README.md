# Log-Analyzer
This project reads a game Log file and analyse it, extracting relevant information about the game match.

The log file inside the project belong to the game 'Quake 3' I think. This was an exercise from a intership interview.

!! I do not own the log file nor the game !!
!! I do not own any of the characters whose name's appear in the log file !!
!! I do not own any kind of 'server information' or anything related to that, that appears in the log file !!

Thank you for your cooperation.

:)
