# Log-Analyzer
This project reads a game Log file and analyse it, extracting relevant information about the game match.

The log file inside the project belong to the game 'Quake 3' I think. This was an exercise from a intership interview.

!! I do not own the log file nor the game !!
!! I do not own any of the characters whose name's appear in the log file !!
!! I do not own any kind of 'server information' or anything related to that, that appears in the log file !!

Thank you for your cooperation.

:)



The code is like this right now, but I'll keep making updates for it. At this moment, there are a lot of bad practices and probably ANTI-PATTERNS but IT IS WORKING. =D 

I just wanted it to take form and work in the beginning.

# For future UPDATES #
1. Take advantage of polymorphism.
2. Make more unit tests.
3. Save the 'generated data' in SQL-SERVER
4. Make a Windows Application.
5. Make use of .NET & ASP and make it WEB.

OBS: If anyone wants to make changes to the source code, please make yourselves at home.
